# Chrome History to Google Sheets

This repository contains all the code you need to start programmatically exporting your browsing history to a Google Sheet.

The reason I created this was to easily serve an API of this data for my [site](https://ferrucc.io) where I'm running a social experiment, to see if my browsing habits change if the data of what I do online is shared publicly.

To create an API from Google Sheets I'm using [Sheety](https://sheety.co/).

This script currently runs every hour.
